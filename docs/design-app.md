# Design application

First, let's use Gemini Code Assist to help us design an application.

Imagine you're new to Google Cloud and you want to design and deploy a
serverless application to Google Cloud. Let's see if Gemini helps us to figure
out our options.

**Answer**
<blockquote>
Google Cloud Functions:

* Event-driven: Responds to events from various sources (e.g., HTTP requests, Cloud Storage changes).
* Pay-as-you-go: Only pay for the resources consumed when your functions execute.
* Fully managed: Google handles infrastructure management, scaling, and security.

Cloud Run:

* Container-based: Deploys containerized applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.
* Fully managed: Google handles container orchestration, scaling, and security.
* HTTP-based: Exposes applications through HTTP endpoints.

App Engine:

* Fully managed: Google handles infrastructure management, scaling, and security.
* Supports multiple languages: Java, Python, Go, Node.js, PHP, Ruby.
* Built-in services: Includes features like authentication, logging, and data storage.

Cloud Functions for Firebase:

* Event-driven: Responds to events from Firebase products (e.g., user authentication, database changes).
* Integrated with Firebase: Easy to use with other Firebase services.
* Pay-as-you-go: Only pay for the resources consumed when your functions execute.

Choosing the Right Option:

Consider the following factors when choosing a serverless option:

* Event-driven vs. HTTP-based: Do you need to respond to events or expose an HTTP endpoint?
* Containerized vs. non-containerized: Do you want to deploy containerized applications or not?
* Language support: Which programming languages do you need to support?
* Built-in services: Do you need access to specific Google Cloud services?
* Cost: Consider the pricing models and resource consumption of each option.

**Prompt**
> What's the difference between Cloud Functions and Cloud Run? Explain to me in simple terms

**Answer**
<blockquote>
Cloud Functions:

* Event-driven: Responds to specific events, such as HTTP requests, database changes, or file uploads.
* Lightweight: Designed for small, single-purpose functions that execute quickly.
* Fully managed: Google handles all infrastructure management, scaling, and security.
* Pay-as-you-go: You only pay for the resources consumed when your functions execute.

Cloud Run:

* Container-based: Deploys containerized applications, which can be more complex and stateful than functions.
* HTTP-based: Exposes applications through HTTP endpoints, similar to traditional web servers.
* Fully managed: Google handles container orchestration, scaling, and security.
* Pay-as-you-go: You pay for the resources consumed by your containers, including CPU, memory, and storage.

Key Differences:

* Event-driven vs. HTTP-based: Cloud Functions responds to events, while Cloud Run exposes HTTP endpoints.
* Lightweight vs. Containerized: Cloud Functions are lightweight and designed for simple tasks, while Cloud Run can handle more complex, stateful applications.
* Pricing: Cloud Functions is typically more cost-effective for small, infrequent tasks, while Cloud Run is better suited for larger, more sustained workloads.

Analogy:

Think of Cloud Functions as small, specialized tools that you can use to automate specific tasks. Cloud Run, on the other hand, is like a more versatile platform where you can deploy and run complete applications.
